    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>How do I know it's not a gimmick?</h2>
      <p>
        Belly button oiling is rooted in Ayurveda and traditional wellness practices, which
        believe that the navel is connected to various bodily functions through nerve endings.
        Scientific studies suggest that certain oils can penetrate the skin and offer
        localized benefits.
      </p>
