    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>
      On a chilly autumn evening in Toronto, Kelly and Alina, both 22, found themselves sharing
      an Uber. Strangers at first, they quickly connected over their love for wellness, health,
      and self-care. What started as casual small talk soon turned into deep conversations about
      life, goals, and their shared passion for living a balanced, healthy lifestyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over time, their friendship grew, filled with yoga sessions, smoothie dates, and
      late-night chats about everything from skincare routines to holistic healing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Months later, during one of their usual catch-ups, they realized that their passion
      for wellness could be more than just a shared interest—it could be a business.
      Both frustrated by the lack of natural, high-quality wellness products, they saw
      an opportunity to create something meaningful. With Kelly’s business mindset
      and Alina’s expertise in nutrition and skincare, they began developing a line
      of belly button oils infused with Ayurvedic and Western ingredients.
    </p>
    <p>
      What started as a simple friendship blossomed into a thriving business, built on
      their shared belief in self-care, sustainability, and empowering others to live
      healthier lives.
